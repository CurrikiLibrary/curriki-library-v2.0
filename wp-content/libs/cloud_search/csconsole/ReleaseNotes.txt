Amazon CloudSearch Command Line Tools 2.0.1.0 Release Notes

This release removes the tools that are superseded by the AWS CLI and adds
support for signing upload requests.  The standalone Amazon CloudSearch
2013-01-01 CLTs now support two operations:

- cs-configure-from-batches
- cs-import-documents

For all other operations, you should use the AWS CLI.  For more information,
