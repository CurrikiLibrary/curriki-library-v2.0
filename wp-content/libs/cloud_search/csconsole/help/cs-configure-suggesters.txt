NAME
       cs-configure-suggesters

DESCRIPTION
       Defines a suggester that you can use to retrieve search suggestions
       based on the contents of a particular text field. Specify the
       --sort-expression option to define an expression to use to sort the 
       suggestions. Specify the --fuzzy-matching option to include suggestions 
       that don't exactly match the specified query string. You can also use 
       this command to update or delete an existing suggester. For more 
       information, see the developer guide topic "Configuring Suggesters in
       Amazon CloudSearch".

       To use a suggester, you submit requests to the domain's search
       endpoint and specify the suggest resource. For more information,
       see the developer guide topic "Retrieving Search Suggestions in
       Amazon CloudSearch".

       -fm,--fuzzy-matching none|low|high
           The level of fuzziness allowed when suggesting matches for a
           query string: none, low, or high. If set to none, the query
           string is treated as an exact prefix. If set to low, suggestions
           must differ from the query string by no more than one character.
           If set to high, suggestions can differ by up to two characters.
           The default is none. Optional.

           control how the suggestions are sorted. Must be enclosed in quotes. 
           By default, the sort expression is set to 0 for all suggestions and 
           the suggestions are sorted by closest match to the query string.

       -sf,--source-field STRING
           The name of the text field to use to generate the suggestions.
           Required when defining a suggester.           

EXAMPLE
       Define a suggester based on the terms that occur in mytextfield,
       calculate a score for each suggestion based on the values of
       myintfield and mynamedexression, and return suggestions that
       differ by no more than one character from the query string:

       cs-configure-suggesters -d mydomain --name mysuggester
           --source-field mytextfield
           --sort-expression '((0.3*myintfield)+(0.7*mynamedexpression))'
           --fuzzy-matching low
